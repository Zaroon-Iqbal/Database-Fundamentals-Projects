In this project, you will translate the Project 1 UML solution into MongoDB collections, using JSON schema documents that I will provide. You will write and submit JSON documents to represent several theater, film, and showing documents. You will design a JSON Schema for a collection of actors who are the "stars" of the films in the database, choosing Mongo-appropriate ways to represent the relationship between films and their starring actors. Finally, you will write a few simple MongoDB queries using the MONGOSH shell in Compass.
