In this project, you will diagram and implement the canonical UML model from project 1 as a relational database in Postgres. Your final deliverables will consist of a ER diagram following the style shown in class, a series of CREATE TABLE statements generated by DataGrip (after you use it to create the tables in your design), and several SQL SELECT queries using your design.
