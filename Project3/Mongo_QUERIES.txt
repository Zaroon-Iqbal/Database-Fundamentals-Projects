--Select the showtime of all Black Panther: Wakanda Forever showings that are on November 11. You don't need to use joins; you can hard-code the filmId of this film. Hint: you can use a filter with both $lt and $gt comparisons. A date is on November 11 2022 if it is greater than midnight of November 11 and less than ____.... To put a date into a query, you must write ISODate("..."), where the parameter is the date in YYYY-MM-DD format.
